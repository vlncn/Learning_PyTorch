# Learning fast.ai Course
This is my Journey and maybe some blog about what i'm doing attending fastai deep learning course
Most of the files in this is just what i did after every lesson.
My Goal for a foreseeable future :
- Model that can guess what the screen is doing from a image
- Model that can guess what the screen is doing from a Video
- Model that can make a python( What I want is AHK) script from a mouse movement in a video. (Deadline 19 June)
Future Goals :
- Model that can make a silhouette from a human body (like those kinect thing, also preferably start by doing hand first)
- Using the model and make the silhouette have a joint and calculate those joint degree to move a servo motor (Basically making a robot mimic human movement)
Dream Goals :
- Have a robot that can record your movement and then replecating that movement (This is probably in 5-10 years in the future)
